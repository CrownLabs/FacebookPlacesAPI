# Facebook Places API w/ Twitter Bootstrap 3 & Twitter’s Typeahead

A combination of the Facebook Places Search API, Twitter Bootstrap 3, and Twitter’s typeahead.js library

To use this tool, replace {fb_app_access_token} with your own Facebook app access token. Do not expose your application access token on the client side. Normally Facebook Graph application access token based calls are made from the server, this is simply just a fun tool we created just to show what's possible with Facebook's Places API.
